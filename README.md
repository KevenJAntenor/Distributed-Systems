# Distributed Systems 

This project demonstrates practical applications of distributed computing concepts including fault tolerance, consistency, and scalability.

## Description

This project implements a distributed system that [brief description of what your system does]. Key features include:

- Distributed architecture using [technologies/protocols]
- Fault tolerance mechanisms
- Data consistency management
- Scalable design
- [Other key features]

Built using [main technologies/frameworks], this system showcases practical implementations of distributed systems concepts learned throughout the course.
