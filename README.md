# 🌐⚙️📡 Distributed Systems

This project demonstrates practical applications of distributed computing concepts, including **fault tolerance**, **consistency**, and **scalability**.

## Description

This project implements a distributed system that **[brief description of what your system does, e.g., manages distributed data, enables collaborative work, etc.]**. 

### Key Features:
- **Distributed Architecture**: Utilizes [technologies/protocols, e.g., gRPC, REST APIs, etc.] to ensure efficient communication across nodes.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Includes mechanisms to handle node failures gracefully, ensuring system reliability.
- **Data Consistency Management**: Implements strategies to maintain consistent data across all nodes, even in the presence of failures.
- **Scalable Design**: Designed to handle growing demands by efficiently adding or removing resources.
- **[Other key features, e.g., real-time updates, load balancing, etc.]**

### Built With:
- [Main technologies/frameworks used, e.g., Python, Java, Kafka, Docker, etc.]
- [Database/Storage technologies, e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.]
- [Other tools, e.g., Kubernetes, Terraform, etc.]

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [List prerequisites, e.g., software versions, dependencies, etc.]
- Example:
  - `Node.js >= v14`
  - `Docker >= v20`
 
## 🚀 How to Run

Follow these steps to set up and run the Python program:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/distributed-systems.git
   cd distributed-systems
Install Dependencies Ensure you have Python installed (version >= 3.8 is recommended). Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the Jupyter Notebook Start Jupyter Notebook to execute the main.ipynb file:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open the Notebook In the Jupyter interface that opens in your web browser, navigate to and open main.ipynb. Execute the cells sequentially to run the program.
